# WWData


In the proposal, you will identify the question and then describe the context. This will be written as a persuasive argument about the value of the insights to be gained from the analysis. In other words, why do we need to know this?

The structure of the proposal is as follows:
A. Introductory paragraph in which the question (from the client) is identified in context.
B. A description of a data source (or sources) that can be used to answer the question. This will include considerations about data quality (methods, validity, reliability).
C. A plan, with benchmarks, for delivery of the analytical report.


Client: Right to the City Alliance
A. Gentrification has been on the minds of New Yorkers for over 20 years -- it's not a new problem here or in other cities around the world. As a problem that disproportionately displaces <a href='https://righttothecity.org/about/mission-history/'>"low-income people, people of color, marginalized LGBTQ communities and youths of color from their historic urban neighborhoods,"</a> equity is a central concern of gentrification. The people who benefit from further study of this problem are the ones whose communities are broken up by new developments or influxes of new tenants and, in so doing, whose voices are often silenced. <br> What can websites like StreetEasy show us about month-by-month rent changes in NYC? Where and when have the fastest rates of change occurred? Do neighborhoods follow the same general patterns, or do rental prices change based on other factors? 
<br><br>
B. The best data source available is from StreetEasy.com itself, showing monthly median rent figures for each neighborhood listed on the StreetEasy site since 2010. Helpful proprietary data would include information about the 
people who use StreetEasy. Are they more likely to be the gentrifiers, the gentrified, or neither? (Judging from 
some qualitative analysis of StreetEasy's marketing campaigns, though, "gentrfiers" seems most likely.)
<br><br>
C. The report will be delivered as a combination of text and charts, and will include an interactive dashboard, allowing users to explore and compare firsthand how monthly median rents have changed in neighborhoods througout the city.
