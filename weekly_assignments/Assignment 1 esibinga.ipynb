The dataset is taken from the real estate site StreetEasy.com and contains monthly median rent figures for each neighborhood listed on the StreetEasy site since 2010. One obvious question is “how have neighborhood monthly rents changed over the last decade?” I also wonder where and when the fastest rates of change have occurred, and if neighborhoods tend to follow similar general patterns or if rental prices respond to different factors depending on the neighborhood.

I hope that a monthly breakdown will offer some more granular information for the process of gentrification. Where and when do rent price increases happen fastest? Can we link them to other co-occurrent factors, such as changes in infrastructure or job markets?"

My dependent variable is rent prices, which is the dataset I currently have. (As an extension of my current dataset, I’m also curious to make and use rate-of-change data, not just the quantity each month.) Independent variables that I’d like to use with this data include the following: the number of jobs in NYC boroughs per month during the same 2010-2020 period; proposed, completed, or in-progress changes to NYC transportation infrastructure (including subway, CitiBike, bus, and congestion pricing); and, potentially, zoning or rent control laws that might impact neighborhood rent prices."

I'm more concerned about fitting my additional/covariate data with my original dataset, but am hoping this will be generally simple using month/year data. It may require reformatting dates or aggregating daily/weekly data as needed. The data I have from StreetEasy is probably less complete than most of the other data I have, but as referenced earlier, this \"in-progress\" nature of the SE data poses an interesting research question in and of itself.
